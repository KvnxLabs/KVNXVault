# KVNX Vault Architecture

Version: 1.0

Author: Doug (Founder)  
Architect: Sensei

## Mission

KVNX Vault is a premium personal progression platform built to help people become the strongest version of themselves.

Every feature must reinforce one idea:

> Build the person who can build the life.

The application should feel calm, premium, intentional, and focused. Never distracting. Never overwhelming. Never gamified for the sake of gamification.

## Core Principles

1. Simplicity beats complexity.
2. Every feature must have a purpose.
3. Performance is a feature.
4. Quality over quantity.
5. The UI should disappear so the user can focus on their growth.
6. Build for years, not weeks.

## Design Language

Inspired by Apple, Linear, Notion, Stripe, and GitHub.

Avoid gaming UI, crypto UI, generic AI websites, excessive gradients, and visual clutter.

## Tech Stack

Current frontend: HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript.

Future possibilities: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, authentication, and AI integration. Do not introduce frameworks until they solve a real problem.

## Navigation Flow

Landing Page → Login → Dashboard → All Application Features.

The landing page is public. Everything else belongs to the application.

## Dashboard Philosophy

The dashboard is the command center. It should answer one question immediately: “What should I do next?” Everything unnecessary should be removed.

## Future Reusable Components

Navigation, Sidebar, XP Card, Mission Card, Skill Card, Achievement Card, Statistic Card, Progress Bar, Modal, Buttons, Notifications, and Charts.

## Naming Convention

- Files: lowercase and dash-separated.
- Variables: camelCase.
- Classes: BEM.
- Functions: verb first.

Examples: `dashboard.html`, `mission-card.js`, `xp-progress.css`, `renderDashboard()`, `updateXP()`, `createMission()`, and `saveVault()`.

## Development Workflow

1. Define the problem.
2. Design the solution.
3. Build the feature.
4. Test locally.
5. Review.
6. Commit.
7. Push.
8. Deploy.

No shortcuts.

## Sprint Workflow

Each sprint contains a goal, acceptance criteria, tasks, implementation, review, and deployment.

## AI Workflow

- Sensei: Product architecture, folder structure, planning, and code review.
- Claude: Implementation, boilerplate, and components.
- Doug: Founder and developer.
